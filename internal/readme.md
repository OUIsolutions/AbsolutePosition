## Absolute Position
Absolute Position it's a position library, created for positional
elements on the screen in an extremely easy way.

## Running
for running , you just need to put the cdn script tag into your project.:
```html
  <script type="text/javascript"  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/OUIsolutions/AbsolutePosition@main/AbsolutePosition.js"></script>
```

## Understanding the Args 

Every time you type and **APosition** inside what ever tag , its became recognizable by the lib
after  you pass the following arguments:
#### #Example:
```html
    <div  APosition=" $16:9        ( 50px, 100px,200px, 300px)">
                      AspectRatio    Left, Top  ,Width, Height
```
#### Measures
you can use(px|%|vh|vw) as the measures (I will add more on the future)

## Operators 
With the Operators **+** and **-**  you can determine positions dynamically on the screen
